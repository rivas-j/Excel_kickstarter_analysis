# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### We have compiled data from Kickstarter Campaigns from the years 2009-2017 in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed trends to help our client decide details for an upcoming fundraiser. We first formatted the Excel data in order to facilitate our analysis. Here are some methods we utilized: 

-Adding colors via conditional formatting to make the spreadsheet more visually striking
-Converting date formats from UNIX to Months/Years
-Separating Kickstarter Campaign categories and subcategories into their own columns 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
