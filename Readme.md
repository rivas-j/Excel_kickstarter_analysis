# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### We have compiled data from Kickstarter Campaigns from the years 2009-2017 in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed trends to help our client decide details for an upcoming fundraiser. We first formatted the Excel data in order to facilitate our analysis. Here are some methods we utilized: 

- Adding colors via conditional formatting to make the spreadsheet more visually striking

- Converting date formats from UNIX to Months/Years

- Separating Kickstarter Campaign categories and subcategories into their own columns

### After improving the data set with formatting, we utilized pivot tables, COUNTIFS formulas, and Line Charts to determine trends surrounding launch dates and how campaign outcomes related the the initial goal amount. Below we will dive into the details around our analysis, and will share our suggestions based on our findings.
