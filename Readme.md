# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Our client ran a Kickstarter campaign for a play called "Fever" that almost reached its goal in a short amount of time. The overall goal of this analysis is to determine how other campaigns during that time fared by looking at launch dates and funding goals.

### We have compiled data from Kickstarter Campaigns from the years 2009-2017 in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed trends to help our client decide details for an upcoming fundraiser. We first formatted the Excel data in order to facilitate our analysis. Here are some methods we utilized: 

- Adding colors via conditional formatting to make the spreadsheet more visually striking

- Converting date formats from UNIX to Months/Years

- Separating Kickstarter Campaign categories and subcategories into their own columns

### After improving the data set with formatting, we utilized pivot tables, COUNTIFS formulas, and Line Charts to determine trends surrounding launch dates and how campaign outcomes related the the initial goal amount. Below we will dive into the details around our analysis, and will share our suggestions based on our findings.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Using a filtered pivot table, we generated this line chart to visualize the relationship between launch dates and the success rate of theather Kickstarter campaigns:

Based on this chart, we're noticing that the month of May yielded the most successful Theater campaigns. The months of May through August, and October, yielded the highest number of failed Theater campaigns. Our conclusion is that May will be the best month for launching a sucessful new Theater campaign. We would advise not starting a Theater campaign in December, where the rate of Successful and Failed are equal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
